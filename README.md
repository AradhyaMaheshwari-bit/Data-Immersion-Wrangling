# 📋 Dataset Information

The dataset contains **1000 sales transactions** with the following fields:

| Column |
|---------|
| Order_ID |
| Order_Date |
| Customer_ID |
| Customer_Name |
| Age |
| Gender |
| City |
| Product |
| Category |
| Quantity |
| Unit_Price |
| Total_Sales |

---

# 📖 Data Dictionary

A detailed **Data Dictionary** describing every column, its data type, description, and business relevance is included in:

**📄 Data_Dictionary.xlsx**

---

# 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

The following preprocessing steps were performed:

### ✅ Dataset Exploration
- Loaded the dataset
- Displayed dataset shape
- Checked column names
- Verified data types
- Previewed first five records

### ✅ Missing Value Handling
- Filled missing values in **Age** using the **Median**
- Filled missing values in **City** using the **Mode**

### ✅ Date Conversion
- Converted `Order_Date` to DateTime format

### ✅ Duplicate Check
- Checked duplicate rows
- Checked duplicate Order IDs

### ✅ Data Validation
- Verified:

```
Total_Sales = Quantity × Unit_Price
```

### ✅ Feature Engineering

Created new columns:

- Year
- Month
- Quarter
- Day_Name

### ✅ Output

Generated a cleaned dataset:

```
Cleaned_ApexPlanet_DataAnalytics_Dataset.xlsx
```
